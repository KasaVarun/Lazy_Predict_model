## About

This repository showcases the capabilities of Lazy Predict, an AutoML tool designed to streamline the process of training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.  𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐠𝐮𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐲 𝐈𝐁𝐌 , and it provides comprehensive examples for both classification and regression tasks, aiding you in swiftly comparing model performance.


## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/KasaVarun/Lazy_Predict_model.git`
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the respective Jupyter notebooks (`prediction.ipynb`) for classification and for regression) to explore the model comparison process.

## Usage

## Flight Delay Prediction:
In the main.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, you'll find the following process:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The notebook loads the flight delay dataset and prepares it for analysis.

Model Evaluation: The LazyClassifier library is utilized to efficiently evaluate and compare the performance of multiple classifiers.

## Admission Chance Prediction:
In the prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, you'll encounter the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The notebook loads the university admissions dataset and prepares it for analysis.

Model Evaluation: The LazyRegressor library is employed to efficiently evaluate and compare the performance of various regression models.

## Dataset Sources

- Airlines : The flight delay dataset used in the classification example is available [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IND-GPXX0JD1EN/Airlines.csv).

- Admissions: The university admissions dataset used in the regression example is available [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IND-GPXX0JD1EN/adm_data.csv).
